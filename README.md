# Simple Password Generator
This is a simple password generator application built using Python and Tkinter. It generates random passwords of varying lengths based on user input. The user can specify the length of the password they require, and the application will generate a random password containing a mix of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and symbols.

## Summary
The Simple Password Generator is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to create strong and secure passwords easily. It provides a straightforward interface where users can input the desired length of the password, and with a click of a button, a randomly generated password is displayed.

## How it Works
The application is built using Python and Tkinter library for creating the GUI. Here's a brief overview of how the application works:

User Input: The user specifies the desired length of the password through an entry field.

Password Generation: When the user clicks the "GENERATE" button, the password_generation() function is triggered. This function generates a random password based on the specified length using a combination of letters, digits, and symbols.

Display Password: The generated password is displayed in an entry field for the user to view and copy.

## About
The Simple Password Generator provides a simple and efficient way to generate strong passwords for various purposes, such as securing accounts, creating secure documents, etc. It ensures that passwords are complex and difficult to guess, thereby enhancing security.

## Topics Covered
Graphical User Interface (GUI) development using Tkinter.
Random password generation.
Handling user input and events.
Basic error handling.

## Modules Used
Tkinter: Tkinter is Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications.
String: The string module provides a collection of functions and constants for working with strings, including letters, digits, and punctuation characters.
Random: The random module is used for generating random numbers and selecting random elements from a sequence. It is used here to shuffle the characters used in password generation.

## Why Use This Application?
Security: Strong passwords are essential for securing online accounts and sensitive information. This application ensures that passwords generated are sufficiently complex, making them difficult to crack.
Convenience: The user-friendly interface makes it easy for users to generate passwords of varying lengths quickly.
Customization: Users can specify the length of the password according to their requirements.

## How to Use
Launch the application.
Enter the desired length of the password in the designated entry field.
Click the "GENERATE" button.
The generated password will be displayed in the output field.
Copy the password and use it as needed.
